# SwiftGit2

Swift bindings to [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2).

> Note: This is a fork of GitHub's [SwiftGit2](http://github.com/SwiftGit2/SwiftGit2) for SPM. The original project seems to be in hibernation since GitHub moved away from a Mac native client. This fork currently only supports macOS 13 or newer. iOS and libssh2 support is not included. SSH transport support might be implemented with [apple/swift-nio-ssh](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-ssh) in the future.
